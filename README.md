# KangarooPool
Kangaroo Pool - Solo pool for Bitcoin Puzzle Transaction 130

Follow the instructions to setup your Kangaroos at this link  https://github.com/ZenulAbidin/Kangaroo-256?tab=readme-ov-file

Connect your Kangaroos to our Heard server at this IP address  99.8.222.129:17403

We will add our masterwork file to this repository every week to kickoff new Kangaroos. Use this file to start your Kangaroo so that it does not have to play catch up and cause a bunch of dead Kangaroos on the Heard server.

We will keep track of IP's as they connect and for how long. To earn a piece of the reward submit an Issue to this repository with your "IP - Bitcoin Address" information.

We plan will release newer software in the future to streamline this process.
